Add in eggs and yolks pulsing a couple times again and scrape down to ensure all is smooth and uniform. With machine running, pour in melted Godiva Chocolate in a steady stream until all in, and finish by pulsing in the cr\u00e8me fraiche. Pour batter into a 10\" x 10\" baking pan and bake at 325 for 30, minutes or until custard is set and a toothpick inserted in center can be removed cleanly. The top may caramelize or brown slightly, which is not an issue. Once set, remove from oven and allow cheesecake to cool completely. Wrap the pan with plastic and reserve in cooler to set and chill completely.\r\n\r\nOnce the cheesecake is cold and firm, remove it from the pan and place in a mixer bowl with a paddle attachment. Beat the cake for a few moments to soften and smooth out the custard. Place smoothed custard into a piping bag with a plain tip and pipe into the bottom of a plastic lined half cylinder mold. Tap the mold to ensure the custard is solid and then flatten out to top. Freeze the mold to harden the custard for unmolding. Once the cake can be unmolded, remove from the pan and cut into 1\u00bd\" sections. Brush some tempered Godiva Dark Chocolate onto a strip of acetate and, while it is still fluid, smooth over the top of the molded cheesecake. Once the chocolate has cooled and completely crystallized, remove the acetate, revealing a shiny and textured chocolate finish.",

Working in batches, drop butter slices into flour mixture and toss to coat; pick up each slice of butter and press between floured fingertips into flat, nickel-sized pieces.  Repeat until all butter is incorporated; toss to combine.  Freeze mixture (in bowl) until chilled, about 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nSpray 24-square-inch work surface with nonstick cooking spray; spread spray evenly across surface with kitchen towel or paper towel.  Sprinkle 1\/3 cup of extra flour across sprayed area; gently spread flour across work surface with palm to form thin, even coating.  Add all but 2 tablespoons of buttermilk to flour mixture; stir briskly with fork until ball forms and no dry bits of flour are visible, adding remaining buttermilk as needed (dough will be sticky and shaggy but should clear sides of bowl).  With rubber spatula, transfer dough onto center of prepared work surface, dust surface lightly with flour, and, with floured hands, bring dough together into cohesive ball.\r\n\r\nPat dough into approximate 10-inch square; roll into 18- by 14-inch rectangle about 1\/4 inch thick, dusting dough and rolling pin with flour as needed.  Using bench scraper or thin metal spatula, fold dough into thirds, brushing any excess flour from surface; lift short end of dough and fold in thirds again to form approximate 6- by 4-inch rectangle.  Rotate dough 90 degrees, dusting work surface underneath with flour; roll and fold dough again, dusting with flour as needed.\r\n\r\nRoll dough into 10-inch square about 1\/2 inch thick; flip dough and cut nine 3-inch rounds with floured biscuit cutter, dipping cutter back into flour after each cut.  Carefully invert and transfer rounds to ungreased baking sheet, spaced 1 inch apart.  Gather dough scraps into ball; roll and fold once or twice until scraps form smooth dough.  Roll dough into 1\/2-inch-thick round; cut 3 more 3-inch rounds and transfer to baking sheet.  Discard excess dough.\r\n\r\nBrush biscuit tops with melted butter.

Place the honey, liquid glucose, water and sugar in a large heavy-based saucepan and heat gently, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves. Increase the heat and cook until the mixture starts to turn a light golden colour. Mix in the baking soda. The mixture will erupt into a foaming mass. Pour immediately into the prepared baking tray.\r\n\r\n2. Leave to cool, then place in the fridge to set. This takes approx 6-10 mins. Break up with the end of a rolling pin and store in an airtight jar if not using immediately.\r\n\r\n3. Using a blender, blitz the raspberries and blueberries together with little caster sugar until smooth. Add a drop of lavender essence. Strain the mixture through a sieve to create a fresh coulis. Taste to check consistency and flavour, add a spoonful of water or sugar as necessary.\r\n\r\n4. Lightly mix almost all of the honeycomb through the yoghurt. Spoon into individual serving glasses and pour the coulis on top. Garnish with lavender flowers and a sprinkling of the remaining honeycomb. Serve immediately.",

        "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 350F. Make the cake: butter three 9-inch round cake pans, and dust with flour, tapping out excess. Sift flour, granulated sugar, cocoa, baking soda, baking powder, and 1 1\/2 teaspoons salt into the bowl of a mixer. Beat on low speed until just combined. Raise speed to medium and add eggs, buttermilk, warm water, oil, and vanilla. Beat until smooth, about 3 minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Divide batter among pans. Bake until cakes are set and a toothpick inserted into the center of each comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Let cool in pans set on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Turn out cakes onto racks and let cool completely.\r\n\r\n3. Make the caramel: Combine granulated sugar, corn syrup, and water in a medium saucepan over high heat. Cook, without stirring, until mixture is dark amber, about 14 minutes. Remove from heat, and carefully pour in cream (mixture will bubble violently); stir until smooth. Return to heat, and cook until a candy thermometer reaches 238F, about 2 minutes. Pour caramel into a medium bowl, stir in 1 teaspoon coarse salt, and let cool slightly, about 15 minutes. Stir in butter, 1 tablespoon at a time. Let cool completely.\r\n\r\n4. Meanwhile, make the frosting: whisk together cocoa and warm water in a bowl until cocoa dissolves. Beat butter, confections' sugar, and a generous pinch of coarse salt in a clean bowl with a mixer on medium speed until pale and fluffy. Gradually beat in melted chocolate and then cocoa mixture until combined. Let stand for 30 minutes before using.\r\n\r\n5. Trim tops of cakes using a serrated knife to creat a level surface. Cut each in half horizontally to form 2 layers. Transfer 1 layer to a serving platter and spread 3\/4 cup caramel over top. Top with another cake layer, and repeat with remaining caramel and cake layers, leaving top uncovered. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour.\r\n\r\n6. Frost top and sides of cake in a swirling motion. Sprinkle with sea salt.\r\n\r\nMake ahead: Caramel can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Bring to room temperature before using. Cake layers can be refrigerated for up to 3 days (they actually taste better when refrigerated and have a better texture for stacking).\r\n\r\nStorage: Frosted cake can be refrigerated for up to 3 days.",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.\r\n\r\nIn a small bowl, using your fingers, combine the orange zest with the sugar \u2013 rubbing the grains as if you were playing with sand to release the orange oils into the sugar.\r\nUsing an electric mixer, beat the oil with the orange sugar until well mixed. In a separate bowl, sift the flour with the baking powder, baking soda and salt.\r\n\r\nAdd the orange juice and brandy to mixer and mix well.\r\n\r\nSlowly incorporate the flour cup by cup until the mixture forms a dough that is not too loose but not quite firm either. It will be dense and wet but not sticky. Once the flour is incorporated fully stop mixing.\r\n\r\nTo roll cookies, pinch a portion of dough off about the size of a walnut. Shape in your palms into a smooth oblong shape, almost like a small egg. Place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Shape and roll cookies until the sheet is filled.\r\n\r\nPress the tines of a large fork in a crosshatch pattern in the center of each cookie. This will flatten them slightly in the center. The cookies should resemble lightly flattened ovals when they go in the oven.\r\n\r\nBake in a preheated 350-degree oven for 25 \u2013 30 minutes until lightly browned. (The cookies will darken when submerged in syrup.)\r\n\r\nWhile the cookies are baking, prepare the syrup.\r\n\r\nIn a saucepan, combine the honey, sugar, water, cinnamon, cloves, and lemon rind. Bring the mixture to a boil then lower the heat and simmer uncovered for about 10 to 15 minutes. Remove the cinnamon, cloves, and lemon rind and stir in lemon juice.\r\n\r\nPlace the ground walnuts in a shallow plate or bowl next to the stove top. When the cookies come out of the oven and while they are still very warm, carefully float the cookies in the syrup and allow the cookies to absorb syrup on both sides.\r\n\r\nUsing a fork or small spatula, remove the cookie from the syrup and place on a platter or plate. Press ground walnuts lightly into the tops of the cookies (syrup will help it adhere) and sprinkle lightly with ground cinnamon.\r\n\r\nDo not refrigerate Melomakarona as they will harden.

Depending on how they are folded (see below), they can be baked or fried. They are holiday tradition on the Greek island of Crete, but eaten at other times as well because they're so delicious! These call for the fresh soft variety of myzithra (not the aged salty type) cheese, and if you can't find it, try Italian mascarpone or ricotta.",

Lightly grease a baking sheet.\r\n\r\nMake the pastry\r\n\r\nOn a floured surface with a rolling pin, roll a piece of dough out to a thickness of about 1\/8th of an inch. Using a 3-4 inch cutter or saucer as a guide, cut out circles. (Alternatively, take a piece of dough the size of an unshelled walnut and roll it out to a circle about 3-4 inches across.)\r\n\r\nPlace a spoonful of the cheese mixture into the center of the circle and spread out close to the edges. Raise the rim of the dough up around the cheese and, with wet fingers, pinch the edges to pull the dough in around the cheese, leaving the center open so the cheese shows.\r\n\r\nRepeat using all the dough and filling. Place the kalitsounia on the baking sheet and brush lightly with beaten egg to glaze. Bake at 350\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) for approximately 20 minutes until lightly browned (see photo). Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon.\r\n\r\nAllow to cool on the baking sheet. Kalitsounia will keep well, covered, in the refrigerator.\r\n\r\nTo fry\r\n\r\nPlace a teaspoonful of cheese mix into the center of the circle, fold the circle over into a half-moon shape. With wet fingers, crimp the edges to close securely. Preheat 1 cup of olive oil over medium heat and fry until golden on both sides. Drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with confectioner's sugar or drizzle with honey.\r\n\r\nYield: 30-36 pieces",

Dough may be scooped into balls, wrapped well, and frozen for up to several months. For hot homemade cookies, FAST, simply place frozen dough balls on a baking sheet, and bake for a minute or so longer than the directions indicate. These cookies stay nice and fresh for a day or so after baking. Freeze for longer storage. To make sure your oven temperature is exactly right, bake a sample cookie first. If the cookie spreads too much, raise the oven temperature slightly. If it doesn't spread enough, lower the oven temperature slightly, or pat the dough down slightly before baking.",

        "instructions": "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Oil two large baking sheets, a bench scraper, and kitchen shears or a sharp knife. Lay a piece of parchment paper or a Silpat on the counter where the canes can dry. Move one of the baking sheets to the warm oven.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in a straight-sided deep saucepan off heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar, and salt and stir them together well. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pot and move it onto medium-high heat. Without stirring, let the syrup come up to 305 degrees. Using a pastry brush or a paint brush dedicated to culinary use, wash down any stray sugar crystals from the side of the pot. Ready the peppermint oil, food coloring, measuring spoons, and vegetable oil. Glove thyself with either heat-retardant gloves or snug mittens covered with disposable gloves.\r\n\r\nOnce the syrup has reached temperature, pour it out onto the room temperature baking sheet. Drizzle the peppermint oil on top, and using the bench scraper, scrape the hot candy up from the bottom and fold it over onto itself to stir it through. Once it has cooled slightly, mix in the vanilla as well. Note that the peppermint scent in the air will be strong.\r\n\r\nContinuously scrape up and stir the syrup to cool it until it becomes a pliable dough. Cut the dough in half and move one piece to the baking sheet inside the warm oven. (First, we\u2019ll \u201cpull\u201d the white half of the candy cane. Then we\u2019ll color the red half.)\r\n\r\nQuickly oil your gloved hands, as it\u2019s now time to pull the candy. Scrape up the candy dough into one piece and, working as quickly and as continuously as you can, pull it out into a rope, double it over onto itself, and twist it together. Pull it, double it, and twist it again. Keep on going this way at a quick clip, and you\u2019ll notice that the candy will start to take on a ribbon-y sheen. This is how the candy will turn white, so keep going until the color is pure. Embrace the upper body workout. Note that anytime the candy becomes too stiff, simply warm it up again in the oven to soften.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t let the candy get too hard. When it\u2019s reached a nice white color, place it onto its baking sheet and move it to the warm oven. Re-oil your bench scraper. Take out the second tray of candy dough and pour on the red food coloring -- about a third of one of those tiny bottles for a good rich color. Use your scraper fold the candy onto itself to incorporate the color completely. Note that this side of the candy cane does not need to be pulled. Move both candy cane trays to the oven and let them warm through for about 5 minutes until pliant.\r\n\r\nOnce warm and squishy enough to work with, take both pieces of candy from the oven and roll them into logs as long as the baking sheet. Cut each log into four equal pieces. Hang on to one red piece and one white piece, moving the rest of the candy back into the oven to keep warm.\r\n\r\nOn the countertop, line the red and white logs alongside one another and begin to twist from one end, stretching as you go, making the candy canes as thin or as thick as you like. Use your oiled shears or knife to cut the length of each cane. Shape the hook of the cane, and press down on the ends to taper. Set the canes aside to cool. (Know, of course, that you could also cut into sticks, rounds, or individual peppermint sucking candy). Admire the individual quality of your handiwork.\r\n\r\nRepeat this process with the remaining 3\/4 of the candy, one piece of each color at a time.\r\n\r\nAllow candy to cool until completely hard; about 15 minutes. Wrap each cane in plastic wrap to keep it from sticking. Store in an airtight jar for several months.",

In a clean bowl, whisk egg whites with a mixer on medium-high speed until stiff peaks form. Fold one-third of the whites into the cupcake batter. Fold in remaining egg whites in 2 batches.\r\n4. Divide batter among baking cups, filling each halfway full. Bake until a toothpick inserted into the center of each comes out clean and the tops spring back when lightly touched, 18 to 20 minutes. Let cool completely in tins set on wire racks.\r\n5. Meanwhile, make the caramel: bring granulated sugar and water to a boil in a small high-sided saucepan, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to medium-high, and cook until mixture just starts to turn pale gold around edges. Remove from heat, and immediately pour caramel onto a rimmed baking sheet. Working quickly, tilt pan to spread caramel to edges to make a very thin layer. Let cool to harden.\r\n6. Make the frosting: beat cream cheese and butter with a mixer on medium-high speed until pale and fluffy. Gradually add confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Beat until creamy and spreadable.\r\n7. Frost each cupcake using an offset spatula. Twist pan to release and break caramel in order for it to resemble broken glass. Place a shard or 2 of caramel \"glass\" in the center of each cupcake. Drizzle or pipe cherry preserves where caramel has entered the cupcake.\r\n\r\nMake ahead: unfrosted cupcakes can be stored at room temperature for up to 2 days. Frosting can be refrigerated for up to 4 days.

        "instructions": "1. Preheat oven to 350F. Make the cake: Coat two 9-inch cake pans with cooking spray. Line bottoms with parchment, and coat with spray. Dust with all-purpose flour, tapping out excess. Whisk together flours, baking soda, and 3\/4 teaspoon salt.\r\n2. Beat butter and sugar with a mixer on medium0high speed until pale and fluffy. Add eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in vanilla. Reduce speed to low. Beat in flour mixture in 3 additions, alternating with buttermilk, beginning and ending with flour. Beat in melted chocolate. Divide batter between pans, and smooth tops using an offset spatula.\r\n3. Bake cakes until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes. Turn out cakes onto racks, remove parchment, and let cool completely.\r\n4. Make the ganache: Bring cream to a gentle simmer in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Pour over chopped chocolates and butter in a bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes. Whisk until smooth and shiny. Let stand until thickened, about 40 minutes. Transfer 1 3\/4 cups ganache to a bowl, and fold in malt balls; reserve remaining ganache.\r\n5. Transfer 1 cake to a serving platter (top side up). Spread ganache-malt ball filling on top, and top with remaining cake (top side up). Refrigerated until set, about 15 minutes. Cut a large wedge from cake to serve on another plate. Pour remaining ganache (reheat if necessary) over cake and wedge, and let drip down sides and into cut center of cake. Garnish cake and platter with rubber cockroaches.\r\n\r\nStorage: Decorated cake can be refrigerated for up to 3 days, but the ganache with not be as shiny,.
